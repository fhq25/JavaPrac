    // 3. Write a method that checks if an integer is odd or even.

    // 4. Write a method that prints all of the odd integers from range 1-100.

    // 5. Write a method that prints all of the even integers from range 1-X, where X is the upper bound.

    // 6. Write a method that checks if an integer is divisible by 3.

    // 7. Write a method that checks if an integer is divisible by 5.

    // 8. Write a method that prints out foo if an integer is divisible by 3, prints out bar if an integer
    // is divisible by 5, and prints out foobar if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

    // 9. Similar to #8, but do it from range 1-X, where X is the upper bound.
